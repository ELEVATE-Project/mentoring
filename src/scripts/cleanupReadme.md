# üßπ PostgreSQL Cleanup Script for Mentoring

This Node.js script connects to a PostgreSQL database and deletes specific records from tables used in a mentoring platform. It's designed to **clean up development, staging, or QA environments** by removing test data related to sessions, user extensions, and organization metadata.

## üìÑ What This Script Does

The script connects to a PostgreSQL database and deletes **all records** from the following tables:

| Table Name               | Description                                                               |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sessions`               | Deletes all session records                                               |
| `session_attendees`      | Removes attendees linked to sessions                                      |
| `session_enrollments`    | Clears all session enrollment records                                     |
| `session_ownerships`     | Removes ownership associations with sessions                              |
| `user_extensions`        | Deletes all user-related extension data                                   |
| `organization_extension` | Deletes all records **except** the one with name `'Default Organization'` |
| `feedbacks`              | Removes all user feedback entries                                         |

Each deletion logs the number of rows removed for transparency.
